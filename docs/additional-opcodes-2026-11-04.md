# Additional opcodes in #117, 2026-11-04

The request remains incomplete. The corrected machine descriptions define 267,359 non-alias selector forms for these twelve opcodes across ten architectures. The inventory records each class's legal combination table, operand spans, semantics and evidence separately. Register values and scheduling fields are additional domains; these counts do not establish exhaustive input or scheduling coverage.

Hardware evidence here is SM89. Other architectures have code generation and independent reference cases for implemented forms. Compiler evidence applies only to successfully compiled probes on their recorded targets; rejected probes remain gaps. Neither compiler traces nor raw discovery captures earn functional verification credit.

Supported counts include native semantics and runtime primitives. Reference/GPU counts below require a complete recorded selector form with positive verification evidence. Unplanned counts measure every supported full form beyond the planner's interaction coverage. Sparse and indexed HMMA, packed LDSM, descriptor variants and branch-depth forms remain visible in the inventory even when unsupported.

Partial counts require operand restrictions and remain included in Unresolved. Reference and GPU columns show complete/partial form counts separately. HMMA cases with UPp=UPT do not establish other accumulator predicate values.

## Reproduction

Run from the repository root; builds and GPU validation require device/JDK access outside the sandbox. No commits, pushes or issue updates are part of this work.

```bash
nice uv run sass-build-languages --coverage
nice uv run python -m tests.autocases SM107 --check
nice uv run pytest tests/test_lifted_semantics.py tests/test_family_lowering.py --family atomic --family asynchronous --family matrix --family control --arch all --fp all
nice uv run pytest tests/test_pcode_semantics.py tests/test_fixtures_emulated.py --family atomic --family asynchronous --family matrix --family control -m ghidra --arch all --fp all
nice uv run pytest tests/test_cases_on_gpu.py tests/test_refs_on_gpu.py --family atomic --family asynchronous --family matrix --family control -m gpu --require-gpu
nice uv run sass-refresh-coverage
nice uv run python -m research.additional_opcodes --out research/additional-opcodes/inventory-current.json --report docs/additional-opcodes-2026-11-04.md
```

Use `--expand` on the inventory command to materialize every legal form rather than its compact combination table. Per-architecture planner gaps are retained as `research/additional-opcodes/plan-gaps-SMxx.json`.

Numerical and cooperative findings, including unfinished behavior, are documented in [hardware-facts.md](hardware-facts.md), [emulation.md](emulation.md) and [open.md](open.md). Compiler identities and hashes are pinned in the inventory. PTX probes are retained under `tests/ptx/`.

Architecture-specific compiler traces and transformed source files are retained in `research/additional-opcodes/compiler-probes.json` and `compiler-sources/`. Reproduce with `nice uv run python -m research.compiler_additional_opcodes --out research/additional-opcodes/compiler-probes.json --sources research/additional-opcodes/compiler-sources`. This distinguishes emitted encodings from compiler/version rejections; numerical behavior remains separately evidenced.

## Replay and PR checks

The retained YOLO replay compares every captured memory region: 201 launches pass, 113 are blocked, 0 differ, and 0 have no memory region to compare. No passing launch executes any of these twelve target opcodes; these passes establish no target-opcode verification. See `research/additional-opcodes/yolo-replay.json`.

PR #119's failing logs identified a stale SM107 case plan and launch tests that still expected Ghidra to reject launch scope. The regenerated plan passes `--check`; the updated launch test compares against the reference and passes locally on SM89/SM90. Remote checks retain their earlier results until the changes are published.
